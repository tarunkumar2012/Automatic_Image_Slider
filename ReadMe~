                        Automatic_Image_Slider 
Basic CSS and JavaScript can be used to Create Such Slider.
This slider  con­tain five pan­els.
It's a slideshow that hides the previous link at the beginning and the next link when you're at the end of the slideshow. 
Have written an  unordered list con­tain­ing four images.
I am using images that are roughly 960 ×720.
The first image will be the one show­ing on page load.
The oth­ers will be hid­den so that we can fade them in when they are selec­ted.
